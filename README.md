> by Massimo Di Pierro (in English)

I have utilized the [web2py framework](http://www.web2py.com/) in numerous projects over the years. It is a great way to learn to create fully functional web applications of any complexity while also learning Python. I totally consumed the fifth edition of this book and am currently delving into the latest (sixth) edition while getting up to speed on a new project. There are differences (updates) to the book and framework, so here I go again.

Svelte is very much worth looking into, because it provides a refreshing point of view and several unique features to the Web.
