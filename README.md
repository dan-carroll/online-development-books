## Python Book List

### [web2py Complete Reference Manual](http://www.web2py.com/book), 6th Edition (pre-release).
> by Massimo Di Pierro (in English)

I have utilized the [web2py framework](http://www.web2py.com/) in numerous projects over the years. It is a great way to learn to create fully functional web applications of any complexity while also learning Python. I totally consumed the fifth edition of this book and am currently delving into the latest (sixth) edition while getting up to speed on a new project. There are differences (updates) to the book and framework, so here I go again.

### [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/html3/)
> Exploring Data Using Python 3  
> by Dr. Charles R. Severance

A great place to start in learning the Python programming language, or just to learn to program.
